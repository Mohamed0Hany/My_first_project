    <h1 style="background-color: yellow; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans ;">Smoking</h1> 

    <p style="font-family: fantasy; font-size: 150%;">it is late to talk about the harms of smoking that can affect a person at all stages of his life
     as a smoker but there is another side
     more dark to smoking which is how smoking affects the mind and manipulation of both of you to continue that habit</p>
    <img src="sphoto1.jpg.jpg" alt="a man smokes" width="100%" >
    <p style="font-family: fantasy; font-size: 150%;">The mind adapts to the actions that occur constantly to
         the extent that it begins with time to derive happiness from and make it one of the actions that 
         the brain performs easily because that act has become within the comfort zone of the mind,
          which contains entertaining and easy actions for the brain
           and <u><b> in the case of smoking</b></u>, these actions appear in simple actions such as
         (picking up the cigarette between the fingers of the hand 
         and placing it in the mouth as a periodic movement - smelling the smell of smoke)</p>

     <h1 style="background-color: yellow; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans ;">So Who are we?</h1>
     
     <p style="font-family: fantasy; font-size: 150%;">We are an organization called <b>"MH organization"</b> 
        <a href="https://www.who.int/ar/news/item/13-01-1445-seven-out-of-10-people-protected-by-at-least-one-tobacco-control-measure" target="_blank">WWW.MH organization.com</a>
        It aims to warn and educate the human being of simple and bad habits that may take his life

         , and you look like a cat chasing his taill, and we are here to stop that, But How? before answering this quistion We should take a look at this statistic.
     <table border="3" >
            <tr><th>Name</th><th>Smoking Period</th><th>Healing Period</th></tr>
            <tr><td>Gamal</td><td> 6 months</td><td> 2 months</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Amina</td><td> 10 months</td><td> 3 months</td></tr>

        </table>
        <p style="font-family: fantasy; font-size: 120%;"> so as you can see The longer the smoking period, the longer the recovery period,
            and sometimes the recovery may not take place, unfortunately....SO i think you are now ready to <b>TAKE A STEP AT THE RIGHT WAY</b> </p>
